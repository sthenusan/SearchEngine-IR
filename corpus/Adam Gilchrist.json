[{"Name": "Adam Gilchrist", "Age": 49, "Birthplace": "Bellingen, New South Wale", "Role": "WK-Batsman", "Bat": "Left Handed Bat", "Bowl": "Right-arm offbreak", "Teams": "Australia, Deccan Chargers, ICC World XI, New South Wales, Western Australia, Middlesex, Punjab Kings, Rest of the World XI, Australian Legends XI, Sagittarius Soldiers, Sagittarius Strikers, Gilchrist XI", "Wicket": "-", "Run": "9619", "Bio": "Going in first or seventh,wearing whites or coloureds,Adam Gilchrist was the symbolic heart of Australia's steamrolling agenda  the most exhilarating cricketer of the modern age,He was simultaneously a cheerful throwback to more innocent times,a flap-eared country boy who walked when given not out in a World Cup semi-final,swatted his second ball for six while sitting on a Test pair,\" is how he once described his philosophy on batting,he seldom strayed from it,Employing a high-on-the-hle grip,he poked good balls into gaps  throttled most others,invariably with head straight,wrists soft  balance sublime,Only at the death did he jettison the textbook,whirling his bat like a hammer-thrower,caring only for the scoreboard  never his average,Still he managed to score at a tempo - 81 per 100 balls in Tests,96 in one-dayers - that made Viv Richards  Gilbert Jessop look like stick-in-the-muds,When he signed a record A$2m sponsorship deal with Puma in 2004,few people questioned his value for money,Indeed it was arguably Gilchrist's belated Test arrival that turned the Australian XI from powerful to overpowering,He bludgeoned 81 on debut,pouched five catches  a stumping,barely paused for breath until stepping down in 2008,Only in the closing stages of an untouchable career did his appetite slow - he was troubled by Andrew Flintoff's around-the-wicket angle during 2005  found the flaw difficult to overcome -  his match-turning 144 against Bangladesh in April 2006 was his first century in 16 Tests"}]
