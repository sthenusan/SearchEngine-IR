[{"Name": "Ricky Ponting", "Age": 46, "Birthplace": "Launceston, Tasmani", "Role": "Batsman", "Bat": "Right Handed Bat", "Bowl": "Right-arm medium", "Teams": "Australia, ICC World XI, Kolkata Knight Riders, Tasmania, Hobart Hurricanes, Mumbai Indians, Surrey, Antigua Hawksbills, Australian Legends XI, Warne Warriors, Ponting XI", "Wicket": "-", "Run": "13704", "Bio": "the most uncompromising player of his generation,grew into Australia's most successful run-maker  only sits below Bradman in the country's overall ratings,It takes an extremely critical eye to diminish his run-scoring achievements,which seem to collect new records in every series,Like spotting a celebrity,it's necessary to look twice when analysing Ponting,first as the archetypal modern batsman,then as the country's 42nd Test captain,There is no doubt about his greatness after taking guard,but his leadership has been under scrutiny for much of his reign,While his blade has sparkled,his stewardship is pock-marked by three  Ashes defeats - two in Engl  one at home -  stumbles to South Africa  India,Those results didn't stop him from becoming the most successful captain in Test history after passing Steve Waugh's 41 wins in the 2009-10 Boxing Day Test,In the same match he overtook Shane Warne's 92 victories as the most by an individual,he led Australia to 26 consecutive undefeated completed World Cup games,He stepped down from the captaincy when that run ended,in the 2011 World Cup,For the first three years of his reign he was in charge of a superstar unit  did not have to decide much tactically,but once that group headed for retirement he had to change from a manager to moulder"}]
